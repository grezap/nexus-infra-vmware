# to open a WinRM HTTP listener on 5985 and a matching firewall rule so
# Packer's winrm communicator can connect and take over from here.
#
# The listener is build-time only -- scripts/99-sysprep.ps1 tears it down
# before generalize so clones never ship with plaintext WinRM open.

# Packer build hangs on "Waiting for WinRM to become available".
